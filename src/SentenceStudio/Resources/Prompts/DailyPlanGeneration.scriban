NOTE: This prompt template is currently UNUSED because plan generation is handled by the DeterministicPlanBuilder service.
This file is kept for potential future LLM enhancement features (e.g., suggesting activity swaps for variety).

If LLM enhancement is re-enabled in the future, this prompt would be used to validate/enhance an already-generated plan,
NOT to generate the plan from scratch. The deterministic builder handles:
- Resource selection (scoring algorithm with freshness/variety rules)
- Vocabulary review decisions (SRS-based)
- Activity sequencing (pedagogical progression: input→output)
- Time allocation (research-backed estimates)

Any future LLM usage should be minimal and focused on creative suggestions only.
