I am a student that speaks English, and I'm learning Korean. I've written this sentence: \"{{user_input}}\". Please grade it for accuracy (does it mean approximately what it should and would I be understood by a native speaker, and uses the vocabulary expected in the recommended translation) and fluency (is this how a native speaker would say this using 존댓말). Also include a recommended version of the sentence based on what you best think I was trying to say.

Use a scale of 0 to 100 where higher is better. 

Format your response as json with properties like this: {\"accuracy_score\": 100, \"accuracy_explanation\": \"\", \"fluency_score\": 100, \"fluency_explanation\": \"\", \"grammar_notes\": {\"original_sentence\": \"\", \"recommended_translation\": \"\", \"explanation\": \"\"}}. 

recommended_translation should be a best version of the sentence based on what you best think I was trying to say.

grammar_notes should be a break down of your recommendation as it compares to my sentence.
