I am a student that speaks {{ native_language }}, and I'm learning {{ target_language }}. I've written this sentence: \"{{user_input}}\"{{if user_meaning && user_meaning != ''}} which I mean to express \"{{user_meaning}}\"{{end}}. 

Please grade it for accuracy (does it mean approximately what it should and would I be understood by a native {{ target_language }} speaker, and uses the vocabulary expected in the recommended translation) and fluency (is this how a native speaker would express this). Also include a recommended version of the sentence based on what you best understood I was trying to say.

Use a scale of 0 to 100 where higher is better. If the vocabulary and grammar are accurate, then score 100. Any improvements for vocabulary, grammar, or fluency should not deduct from the score but only be included in the explanations. Any improvements to formality should also not deduct from the score unless the formality used is completely wrong.

Keep in mind these guidelines:

* Use polite/standard register appropriate for {{ target_language }}
* Use spoken/conversational form, not formal written style
