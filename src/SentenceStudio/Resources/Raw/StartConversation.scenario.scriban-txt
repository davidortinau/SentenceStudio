Start the conversation with an appropriate greeting for this scenario.

As {{ scenario.persona_name }}, {{ scenario.persona_description }}, begin by greeting the customer/person naturally in Korean and asking an appropriate opening question for this situation:

Situation: {{ scenario.situation_description }}

{{ if scenario.conversation_type == "Finite" }}
This is a transactional conversation, so ask something relevant to completing the transaction (e.g., "무엇을 주문하시겠어요?" for ordering, "어디 가시려고요?" for directions).
{{ else }}
This is an open-ended conversation, so ask something to get to know them or explore the topic.
{{ end }}

Only respond with your greeting and question in Korean - nothing else.
