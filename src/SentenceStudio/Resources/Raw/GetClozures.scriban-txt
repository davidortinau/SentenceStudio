Using the following Korean vocabulary ({{ for t in terms }}{{- t.target_language_term -}}{{if for.last == false }}, {{ else }}{{ end }}{{ end }}), generate {{ number_of_sentences }} Korean sentences for clozure exercises. For each sentence:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Use EXACTLY one vocabulary word from the provided list in each sentence** - do not create new words
2. **Create natural conversational sentences** using common speech patterns
3. **vocabulary_word should be the dictionary form** from the provided vocabulary list
4. **vocabulary_word_as_used should be the conjugated form** that naturally fits in the conversational sentence
5. **Generate 5 plausible multiple-choice options** for `vocabulary_word_guesses`:
   - Include the correct conjugated form (same as `vocabulary_word_as_used`)
   - Add 4 other conjugated Korean words as distractors (similar conjugation patterns)
   - All 5 options should be plausible in the sentence context
6. **Include a recommended_translation** showing the English meaning of the sentence

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
If vocabulary word is "먹다" (to eat):
- sentence_text: "나는 점심을 __" (with __ as placeholder)
- recommended_translation: "I eat lunch"
- vocabulary_word: "먹다" 
- vocabulary_word_as_used: "먹어요" (conjugated form that fits the sentence)
- vocabulary_word_guesses: "먹어요,마셔요,봐요,가요,와요" (5 options including the correct one)
