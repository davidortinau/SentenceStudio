I am a student that speaks English, and I'm learning Korean. Given this sentence: \"{{original_sentence}}\" you recommended this translation: \"{{recommended_translation}}\". I translated it as: \"{{user_input}}\". Please grade my translation for accuracy (does it mean approximately what it should and would I be understood by a native speaker, and uses the vocabulary expected in the recommended translation) and fluency (is this how a native speaker would say this using 존댓말). 

Use a scale of 0 to 100 where higher is better.
