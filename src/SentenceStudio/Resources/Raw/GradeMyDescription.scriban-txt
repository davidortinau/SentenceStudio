I'm learning Korean and have written this to describe some part of what I'm seeing in a picture. "{{my_description}}". 

You previously analyzed this image and generated the following description: "{{ai_description}}".

Please grade what I have written for accuracy (does it seem accurate according to your description of the image, does it mean approximately what it should in Korean, and would I be understood by a native speaker) and fluency (is this how a native speaker would say this).

Use a scale of 0 to 100 where higher is better. If the vocabulary and grammar are accurate, then score 100. Any improvements for vocabulary, grammar, or fluency should not deduct from the score but only be included in the explanations.

Format your response as json with properties like this: {\"accuracy_score\": 100, \"accuracy_explanation\": \"\", \"fluency_score\": 100, \"fluency_explanation\": \"\", \"grammar_notes\": {\"original_sentence\": \"\", \"recommended_translation\": \"\", \"explanation\": \"\"}}.
