# Dashboard Progress Visualizations

## Overview

Enhanced the SentenceStudio dashboard with motivating visual progress indicators to help users track their learning journey and stay motivated.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Vocabulary Progress Card

- **Visual**: Horizontal progress bars showing distribution of vocabulary across learning phases
- **Data**: New, Learning, Review, Known word counts
- **Motivation**: 7-day accuracy percentage to show recent performance
- **Colors**: Color-coded progress (Green=Known, Orange=Review, Blue=Learning, Gray=New)

### 2. Resource Progress Card  

- **Visual**: List of recently practiced learning resources with proficiency scores
- **Data**: Top 3 most recent resources with completion percentage, attempts, accuracy, time spent
- **Motivation**: Shows progression on specific materials
- **Colors**: Color-coded proficiency levels (Red <40%, Orange 40-60%, Green 80%+)

### 3. Skill Progress Card

- **Visual**: Large circular-style progress indicator for selected skill
- **Data**: Current proficiency percentage, 7-day trend (Â±%), last activity date
- **Motivation**: Clear skill-level mastery tracking with trend arrows
- **Colors**: Same proficiency color scheme as resources

### 4. Practice Streak Card

- **Visual**: GitHub-style contribution calendar showing practice activity over the last year (52 weeks)
- **Data**: Daily practice counts visualized as intensity-colored squares in a calendar grid layout
- **Motivation**: Familiar GitHub contribution graph format encourages consistent daily practice
- **Features**:
  - **Full year view**: 52-week calendar grid (like GitHub contributions)
  - **Month labels**: Positioned above the grid showing month abbreviations
  - **Day labels**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday labels on the left (GitHub style)
  - **Color intensity**: 6-level green intensity scale based on daily practice count
  - **Current streak**: Shows consecutive days of practice
  - **Longest streak**: Historical best streak record
  - **Total practices**: Annual practice count in header
  - **Legend**: "Less/More" activity level indicator
- **Layout**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop viewing with proper square spacing

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **DTOs**: Lightweight progress data transfer objects in `Services/Progress/`
- **Service**: `IProgressService` aggregates data from existing repositories
- **Components**: Modular MauiReactor components for each visualization type
- **Responsive**: Adapts layout for phone (vertical stack) vs tablet/desktop (2x2 grid)

### Data Sources

- **Vocabulary**: Aggregated from `VocabularyProgressService` mastery scores
- **Resources**: Derived from learning resource vocabulary associations and progress
- **Skills**: Computed from vocabulary mastery within skill context  
- **Practice**: **Unified tracking** via `UserActivity` as the single source of truth:
  - **All activity types**: Warmup, Writer, SceneDescription, Translation, VocabularyQuiz, Clozure, etc.
  - **Consistent timestamps**: All activities recorded with `CreatedAt` for accurate daily totals
  - **Quality metrics**: Each activity includes Fluency and Accuracy scores
  - **Simple aggregation**: Daily practice counts based on UserActivity records only

### Performance

- **Async Loading**: Progress data loads in background, doesn't block UI
- **Caching**: Service layer can cache results for short TTL
- **Lightweight**: Simple calculations, no heavy database operations
- **Graceful**: Handles missing data with empty states

## User Experience

### Motivation Factors

1. **Visual Progress**: Clear bars and percentages show advancement
2. **Recent Focus**: Highlights recent work to show immediate progress  
3. **Streaks**: Gamified daily practice tracking
4. **Trends**: 7-day deltas show momentum (positive/negative)
5. **Achievements**: Color-coded mastery levels provide clear goals

### Layout

- **Phone**: Single column, scrollable stack for easy mobile browsing
- **Tablet/Desktop**: 2x2 grid layout for efficient space utilization
- **Themes**: Respects existing light/dark theme preferences
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors, clear labels, proper sizing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Syncfusion Charts**: Upgrade simple progress bars to rich doughnut/radial charts
2. **Detailed Heatmap**: 8-week calendar view with Syncfusion HeatMap control
3. **Sparklines**: Trend lines for vocabulary/skill progression over time
4. **Goal Setting**: User-defined targets with progress tracking
5. **Achievements**: Badge system for milestones (streaks, mastery levels)
6. **Timeframe Controls**: Toggle between daily/weekly/monthly views

### Technical Improvements

1. **Caching**: Redis/in-memory cache for computed progress metrics
2. **Incremental Updates**: Real-time progress updates during activities
3. **Offline Support**: Store computed metrics locally for offline viewing
4. **Analytics**: Track which visualizations motivate users most
5. **Personalization**: User preferences for which cards to show/hide

## Files Modified/Added

### New Files

- `Services/Progress/IProgressService.cs` - Service interface and DTOs
- `Services/Progress/ProgressService.cs` - Implementation with data aggregation
- `Pages/Dashboard/VocabProgressCard.cs` - Vocabulary distribution visualization  
- `Pages/Dashboard/ResourceProgressCard.cs` - Recent resources progress
- `Pages/Dashboard/SkillProgressCard.cs` - Selected skill proficiency display
- `Pages/Dashboard/PracticeStreakCard.cs` - Daily practice streak tracking

### Modified Files

- `MauiProgram.cs` - Added progress service DI registration
- `SentenceStudio.csproj` - Added Syncfusion visualization packages  
- `Pages/Dashboard/DashboardPage.cs` - Integrated progress section with responsive layout

## Usage

The progress visualizations automatically appear on the dashboard after selecting learning resources and skills. Data loads asynchronously in the background and updates the UI when ready. No user configuration required - it works out of the box with existing learning data.
