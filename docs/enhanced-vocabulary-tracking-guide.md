# Enhanced Vocabulary Progress Tracking System

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the enhanced vocabulary progress tracking system implemented in SentenceStudio. The system provides rigorous tracking and learning analytics while maintaining backward compatibility with existing activities.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Mastery-Based Scoring
- **Mastery Score**: 0.0 to 1.0 scale using weighted rolling averages
- **Learning Status**: Unknown (0), Learning (0.1-0.79), Known (0.8+)
- **Time Decay**: Scores decrease over time without practice

### ðŸ“ˆ Phase-Based Learning
- **Recognition Phase**: Multiple choice, basic comprehension
- **Production Phase**: Text entry, active recall
- **Application Phase**: Conjugated forms, complex usage

### ðŸ”„ Spaced Repetition
- **SM-2 Algorithm**: Intelligent review scheduling
- **Dynamic Intervals**: Adapts based on performance
- **Review Candidates**: Automatic identification of words due for review

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Analytics
- **Response Time Tracking**: Measure cognitive load
- **Difficulty Weighting**: Context-aware difficulty assessment  
- **Confidence Ratings**: Optional self-assessment
- **Multi-User Support**: Individual progress tracking

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Basic Usage

```csharp
// Record a vocabulary attempt
var attempt = new VocabularyAttempt
{
    VocabularyWordId = wordId,
    UserId = currentUserId,
    Activity = "VocabularyQuiz",
    InputMode = "MultipleChoice",
    WasCorrect = isCorrect,
    DifficultyWeight = 0.8f, // Multiple choice is easier
    ContextType = "Isolated",
    ResponseTimeMs = responseTime,
    UserInput = userAnswer,
    ExpectedAnswer = correctAnswer
};

var progress = await progressService.RecordAttemptAsync(attempt);
```

### 2. Activity Integration

#### VocabularyQuiz Integration
```csharp
private async Task RecordQuizAnswer(bool isCorrect, string userInput, int responseTimeMs)
{
    var inputMode = currentItem.IsPromoted ? InputMode.Text : InputMode.MultipleChoice;
    var difficultyWeight = inputMode == InputMode.Text ? 1.2f : 0.8f;
    
    var attempt = new VocabularyAttempt
    {
        VocabularyWordId = currentItem.Word.Id,
        UserId = GetCurrentUserId(),
        Activity = "VocabularyQuiz", 
        InputMode = inputMode.ToString(),
        WasCorrect = isCorrect,
        DifficultyWeight = difficultyWeight,
        ContextType = "Isolated",
        LearningResourceId = GetCurrentResourceId(),
        UserInput = userInput,
        ExpectedAnswer = GetExpectedAnswer(),
        ResponseTimeMs = responseTimeMs
    };
    
    var updatedProgress = await progressService.RecordAttemptAsync(attempt);
    
    // Update UI based on new mastery score
    UpdateProgressDisplay(updatedProgress);
}
```

#### Clozure Activity Integration
```csharp
private async Task RecordClozureAnswer(bool isCorrect, string userInput, int responseTimeMs)
{
    var contextType = DetermineContextType(); // "Sentence", "Conjugated", etc.
    var difficultyWeight = CalculateDifficulty(contextType);
    
    var attempt = new VocabularyAttempt
    {
        VocabularyWordId = challenge.VocabularyWordId,
        UserId = GetCurrentUserId(),
        Activity = "Clozure",
        InputMode = GetInputMode(),
        WasCorrect = isCorrect,
        DifficultyWeight = difficultyWeight,
        ContextType = contextType,
        LearningResourceId = Props.Resource?.Id,
        UserInput = userInput,
        ExpectedAnswer = challenge.ExpectedAnswer,
        ResponseTimeMs = responseTimeMs
    };
    
    await progressService.RecordAttemptAsync(attempt);
}
```

### 3. Progress Querying

```csharp
// Get individual word progress
var progress = await progressService.GetProgressAsync(wordId, userId);

// Get words due for review
var reviewWords = await progressService.GetReviewCandidatesAsync(userId);

// Get all user progress
var allProgress = await progressService.GetAllProgressAsync(userId);

// Check learning status
if (progress.Status == LearningStatus.Known)
{
    // Word is mastered (80%+ mastery score)
}
else if (progress.Status == LearningStatus.Learning)
{
    // Word is in progress
}
```

## Difficulty Weight Guidelines

### Input Mode Weights
- **Multiple Choice**: 0.6 - 0.8 (easier)
- **Text Entry**: 1.0 - 1.2 (standard)
- **Voice Input**: 1.3 - 1.5 (harder)

### Context Type Weights
- **Isolated**: 1.0 (base difficulty)
- **Sentence**: 1.2 - 1.4 (moderate context)
- **Conjugated**: 1.5 - 2.0 (complex usage)

### Activity-Specific Adjustments
```csharp
private float CalculateDifficultyWeight(string activity, string inputMode, string contextType)
{
    float baseWeight = 1.0f;
    
    // Activity adjustments
    switch (activity)
    {
        case "VocabularyQuiz":
            baseWeight = inputMode == "Text" ? 1.2f : 0.8f;
            break;
        case "Clozure":
            baseWeight = 1.5f; // Context makes it harder
            break;
        case "Conversation":
            baseWeight = 1.8f; // Real-time usage is hardest
            break;
    }
    
    // Context adjustments
    if (contextType == "Conjugated")
        baseWeight *= 1.5f;
    
    return Math.Min(2.0f, Math.Max(0.5f, baseWeight));
}
```

## Migration and Backward Compatibility

### Database Migration
The system includes a migration that:
- Adds new fields to VocabularyProgress
- Preserves existing MultipleChoiceCorrect/TextEntryCorrect fields
- Updates table names and constraints
- Populates new fields with sensible defaults

### Legacy API Support
All existing methods continue to work:

```csharp
// Legacy methods still work
var progress = await progressService.GetOrCreateProgressAsync(wordId);
await progressService.RecordCorrectAnswerAsync(wordId, InputMode.Text);
await progressService.RecordIncorrectAnswerAsync(wordId, InputMode.MultipleChoice);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Rolling Average Calculation
- Limited to last 5 attempts by default
- Uses recency weighting (more recent = higher weight)
- Includes time decay factor
- Optimized database queries

### Spaced Repetition
- Review intervals: 1 day â†’ 6 days â†’ exponential growth
- EaseFactor adjustment: Â±0.1 based on performance
- Automatic review candidate identification

## Analytics and Insights

### Response Time Analysis
```csharp
if (attempt.ResponseTimeMs > 10000)
{
    // Slow response - word may be difficult
    await LogInsight(wordId, "slow_response");
}
else if (attempt.ResponseTimeMs < 2000 && attempt.WasCorrect)
{
    // Fast correct response - good mastery
    await LogInsight(wordId, "quick_mastery");
}
```

### Error Pattern Detection
```csharp
if (!attempt.WasCorrect && attempt.ContextType == "Conjugated")
{
    // User struggles with conjugation
    await LogInsight(wordId, "conjugation_difficulty");
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Thresholds (Adjustable)
```csharp
private const float MASTERY_THRESHOLD = 0.8f;        // Known status
private const float PHASE_ADVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7f;  // Phase progression
private const int ROLLING_AVERAGE_COUNT = 5;         // Attempts to consider
```

### Phase Advancement Rules
- Recognition â†’ Production: 70%+ accuracy, 3+ attempts
- Production â†’ Application: 70%+ accuracy, 3+ attempts
- Automatic progression based on performance

## Best Practices

### 1. Accurate Difficulty Weights
- Consider all factors: input mode, context, activity
- Use consistent scales across activities
- Test and calibrate based on user performance

### 2. Meaningful Context Types
- Be specific: "Conjugated", "Passive Voice", "Conditional"
- Group similar contexts for analysis
- Use consistent naming across activities

### 3. Response Time Tracking
- Start timer when question is presented
- Stop when answer is submitted
- Handle pauses and interruptions appropriately

### 4. User Confidence (Optional)
- Simple 1-5 scale or slider
- Collect after answer, not before
- Use for additional score weighting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Mastery scores not updating**
- Check that WasCorrect is set correctly
- Verify DifficultyWeight is reasonable (0.5-2.0)
- Ensure RecordAttemptAsync is being called

**Phase advancement not working**
- Check accuracy calculation for specific phase
- Verify minimum attempt count is met
- Review PHASE_ADVANCE_THRESHOLD setting

**Review candidates not appearing**
- Check NextReviewDate is being set
- Verify current date comparison
- Ensure Status is not already "Known"

### Debug Information
```csharp
Debug.WriteLine($"Word {wordId}: Mastery={progress.MasteryScore:F2}, " +
               $"Phase={progress.CurrentPhase}, " +
               $"NextReview={progress.NextReviewDate}");
```

## Future Enhancements

- Cross-word interference analysis
- Personalized review scheduling
- Export/import of progress data
