# Project Context

- **Owner:** David Ortinau
- **Project:** SentenceStudio — a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid language learning app
- **Stack:** .NET 10, MAUI, Blazor Hybrid, MauiReactor (MVU), .NET Aspire, EF Core, SQLite, OpenAI
- **Created:** 2026-03-07

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

- Project uses MauiReactor for native pages: `VStart()` not `Top()`, `VEnd()` not `Bottom()`, `HStart()`/`HEnd()` not `Start()`/`End()`
- NEVER use emojis in UI — use Bootstrap icons (bi-*) or text. Non-negotiable.
- The user goes by "Captain" and prefers pirate talk
- All entities synced via CoreSync use string GUID PKs
- Database migrations MUST use `dotnet ef`, never raw SQL ALTER TABLE
- NEVER delete user data or database files
- Build with TFM: `dotnet build -f net10.0-maccatalyst`
- E2E testing is mandatory for every feature/fix
- Activities follow pattern: `activity-page-wrapper` → `PageHeader` → `activity-content` → `activity-input-bar`
