# Decision: M.E.AI 10.5.0 Strategic Review — Defer Features, Ship Three Debt Actions

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Authors:** Wash (audit), River (verification), Zoe (strategy)  
**Status:** RECOMMENDATION — awaiting Captain's call  
**Cycle:** M.E.AI 10.5.0 Strategic Review (analysis cycle, no code changes)

---

## TL;DR

- **Adopt nothing from M.E.AI 10.5.0 itself this quarter.** The headline "rate-limit retry" is a hallucination, VectorData is experimental greenfield with no consuming feature, and the TTS/Realtime APIs shipped in 10.4.1 (not 10.5.0) and are experimental — disqualified for DX24 production device.
- **Do fix three latent issues Wash uncovered that are independent of 10.5.0:** (1) add Polly-based 429/5xx retry to the OpenAI `HttpClient`, (2) introduce `Directory.Packages.props` and unify the M.E.AI/Agents.AI/HelpKit version split, (3) move the `gpt-4o-mini` literal and ElevenLabs voice IDs into config.
- **Do NOT pre-wrap ElevenLabs behind `ITextToSpeechClient`.** The abstraction is experimental, ElevenLabs-specific features (voice IDs, `eleven_multilingual_v2`) leak through `RawRepresentationFactory` anyway, and we have no second provider on the roadmap. Wait and do the wrap + Realtime adoption together when both stabilize.
- **Schedule a VectorData pilot only when a "practice more like this" or transcript-search feature is on the roadmap.** Don't build embeddings infrastructure speculatively.
- **Set a calendar reminder for the v11 GA window** (likely Nov 2026 timeframe) — that's when Realtime + TTS abstractions are expected to drop the `[Experimental]` tag and become DX24-eligible.

## Verified Facts (Captain's Brief vs Reality)

| Brief Claim | Reality | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `UseRateLimitRetry()` is a new M.E.AI middleware | **Does not exist.** Hallucination. Standard path is `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` (Polly). | River verification §1 |
| VectorData migrated from Semantic Kernel to `dotnet/extensions` | **True.** PR #7434. APIs remain `[Experimental]`. Source-breaking ctor rename only (`Dimensions` → `dimensions`). | River verification §1 |
| Realtime + TTS APIs in 10.5.0 | **Wrong version.** Shipped in **10.4.1** (March 2026). Both `[Experimental]`. 10.5.0 is bug fixes + the VectorData move. | River verification §1 |
| Our app already has retry on OpenAI traffic | **No.** `AddStandardResilienceHandler()` is on the MAUI→API gateway only. Direct OpenAI SDK traffic builds its own `HttpClient` with no resilience. | Wash audit §2 |
| Our M.E.AI usage is consistent across heads | **No.** Server is on M.E.AI 10.2.0-preview, AppLib is on Agents.AI 1.0.0-preview, HelpKit is on M.E.AI.Abstractions 9.5.0. Three families, three versions. | Wash audit §1 |

---

## What the Audit Reveals About TODAY's Risk Surface

These are independent of 10.5.0 and would be issues even if Microsoft never shipped another M.E.AI release.

### 3.1 The IChatClient pipeline is naked

Five `IChatClient` registration sites. The two server projects (Api, Workers) have **zero middleware** — not even logging. The two client projects (AppLib, WebApp) have only `.UseLogging()`. There is no retry, no telemetry, no caching, no function-invocation middleware on any pipeline. If OpenAI returns a transient 503 during a quiz generation, it propagates as an uncaught exception to the user. We've been lucky, not safe.

### 3.2 The Aspire/standalone dual path is a silent quality fork

When MAUI runs against Aspire, OpenAI calls proxy through the API and inherit `AddStandardResilienceHandler()`. When MAUI runs standalone (which is the DX24 production posture), calls go direct to OpenAI with **no resilience whatsoever**. This means production behavior on Captain's phone is *less* resilient than dev behavior on his laptop. That's an architectural inversion — production should be the most defended path, not the least.

### 3.3 The package family is fragmented across three SKUs and three versions

- Server: `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI` 10.2.0-preview
- AppLib: `Microsoft.Agents.AI` + `Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI` 1.0.0-preview (a *different* product line that wraps M.E.AI)
- HelpKit: `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` 9.5.0

There is no `Directory.Packages.props`. Every csproj pins independently. Future M.E.AI upgrades will require touching N csprojs and resolving N transitive conflicts — and the Agents.AI vs M.E.AI choice was likely made implicitly rather than deliberately.

### 3.4 Hardcoded magic values that should be config

- `gpt-4o-mini` appears as a string literal in at least 5 places (Api, Workers, AppLib, WebApp, HelpKitIntegration).
- 7 ElevenLabs Korean voice IDs are hardcoded in `ElevenLabsSpeechService.cs`.
- `tts-1` model name hardcoded in `AiClient.cs:31`.
- `text-embedding-3-small` hardcoded in HelpKit.

Any model upgrade (e.g., to `gpt-4o-mini-2025-something` or to a cheaper future model) is a multi-file PR instead of a config change.

### 3.5 HelpKit's `RetrievalService.NotImplementedException`

Wash flagged a `throw new NotImplementedException("Wash: wire to VectorData store")` in `RetrievalService.cs:60`. That's a live land-mine — if any HelpKit code path reaches it, the app throws. Either delete the code path or wire it. This is unrelated to 10.5.0 but it's debt visible in the same audit.

## The Four-Quadrant Decision

| Feature | Verdict | Trigger to flip |
|---|---|---|
| (a) 429 retry | **Adopt now** (but via Polly, not the fictional API) | N/A — do it |
| (b) VectorData | **Defer** | First feature spec that requires semantic similarity |
| (c) TTS abstraction (`ITextToSpeechClient`) | **Defer** | Stable (non-experimental) release AND a second TTS provider is on the roadmap |
| (d) Realtime API (`IRealtimeClient`) | **Defer (high interest)** | Stable release — then pilot a "Live Conversation Practice" activity |

### (a) 429 / transient retry — **ADOPT NOW**

The brief's specific API is fictional, but the gap it points at is real and Wash confirmed it: zero retry on direct-to-OpenAI traffic, which is exactly the path DX24 uses in production. The right fix is `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` configured on the `HttpClient` that backs `OpenAIClient`, with a retry policy that honors `Retry-After` headers and handles `HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests` plus transient 5xx. This is a small, well-understood, non-experimental change. **Scope:** ~1 day. **Risk:** low.

### (b) VectorData — **DEFER**

We have zero embedding usage in the main app (HelpKit's tiny in-memory cosine store is isolated). The APIs are `[Experimental]`. Adding them speculatively is premature optimization with a real maintenance tax. **Trigger:** when product specs a feature that genuinely needs semantic similarity (River's "practice more like this," transcript chunk search, or synonym-aware spaced repetition), pilot then. Until then, the code we don't write is the code we don't have to refactor when the API stabilizes.

### (c) `ITextToSpeechClient` — **DEFER**

Three reasons stack: (1) experimental, (2) ElevenLabs is our intentional choice for Korean voice quality and we use provider-specific features that would leak through `RawRepresentationFactory` even with the abstraction, (3) we have no second TTS provider on the roadmap, so DI-swappability has no consumer. The abstraction's option-value is currently zero. **Trigger:** stable release **and** a concrete plan to A/B Korean TTS providers or offer users a choice.

### (d) `IRealtimeClient` — **DEFER (high interest)**

This is the most genuinely transformative API for a language-learning app — bidirectional audio streaming collapses our STT→Chat→TTS pipeline into one session and would enable a "Live Conversation Practice" activity that we cannot reasonably build today. But: experimental, OpenAI-pricing-significant, and the .NET-side OpenAI provider is using raw WebSocket/JSON because the OpenAI SDK's realtime support wasn't ready at merge. Three breaking-change vectors at once. **Trigger:** experimental tag drops AND OpenAI .NET SDK ships first-class realtime support. At that point, scope a pilot activity for non-DX24 testing first.

---

## Pre-Wrap Decision: ElevenLabs Behind `ITextToSpeechClient` Now?

**No. Wait and do both swaps together when Realtime stabilizes.**

The abstraction-cost vs option-value trade-off:

**Cost of wrapping now:**
- Build an `ITextToSpeechClient` adapter over `ElevenLabsSpeechService`.
- Lose strong typing on Korean voice IDs and `eleven_multilingual_v2` model selection — they become `RawRepresentationFactory` opaque blobs or out-of-band config, both of which are worse than the current direct API.
- Take a dependency on an experimental package on DX24 (violates Captain's production rule) OR keep two parallel paths until stable, which is strictly worse.

**Value of wrapping now:**
- DI-swappability we don't need (no second provider on roadmap).
- "Readiness" for Realtime — but Realtime is a *different* abstraction. Wrapping TTS does not accelerate Realtime adoption.

**The bet:** when Realtime stabilizes (likely in the v11 timeframe), we'll do the Realtime adoption as one focused workstream. At that time we can decide whether to also adopt `ITextToSpeechClient` for the non-realtime path. Doing them together = one migration, one regression pass, one TTS contract. Doing them separately = two migrations, two passes, throwaway intermediate abstraction.

---

## Three Concrete Actions Worth Doing NOW (Independent of 10.5.0 Hype)

### Action 1: Add Polly resilience to the OpenAI HttpClient

**Why:** Closes the dual-path gap. DX24 production gets the same retry behavior as Aspire-connected dev. Honors `Retry-After` on 429s and retries transient 5xx.

**How:** Register `OpenAIClient` via a typed `HttpClient` factory (or attach `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`'s standard handler to the named client OpenAI uses internally). Use the standard resilience pipeline with retry + circuit breaker, configured with conservative defaults (3 retries, exponential backoff, 30s circuit-break window).

**Where:** The five registration sites Wash enumerated. Centralize in a shared extension method (e.g., `services.AddSentenceStudioOpenAIClient(...)`) so all heads share one configuration.

**Scope:** ~1 day. **Risk:** low. Non-experimental. No consumer-visible change unless something is currently failing silently.

### Action 2: Introduce `Directory.Packages.props` and unify the AI package family

**Why:** Three packages, three versions today. Future upgrades are O(N csprojs). With CPM, future upgrades become O(1).

**How:** Create `Directory.Packages.props` at the repo root. Move all package versions there. Pin the M.E.AI family deliberately:
- `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI` and `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` to a single 10.x version.
- Decide explicitly: do we keep `Microsoft.Agents.AI` in AppLib, or migrate it to plain M.E.AI? (Agents.AI buys us very little — we don't use multi-agent orchestration. Recommend migrating to plain M.E.AI and deleting the SKU split.)
- Bump HelpKit from 9.5.0 to match.

**Scope:** ~2 days including the Agents.AI → M.E.AI migration in AppLib. **Risk:** medium (touches every AI call site). **Payoff:** strong long-term.

### Action 3: Move model + voice IDs to config

**Why:** Model upgrades become single-line config changes instead of multi-file PRs. Also enables per-environment overrides (e.g., a cheaper model in dev, premium in production).

**How:** Add an `AI` section to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "AI": {
    "ChatModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "EmbeddingModel": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "TtsModel": "tts-1",
    "ElevenLabsModel": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
    "ElevenLabsKoreanVoices": [ /* 7 IDs */ ]
  }
}
```

Bind via `IOptions<AIOptions>`. Replace the literals in the 5+ sites Wash identified.

**Scope:** ~½ day. **Risk:** low. **Pairs naturally with Action 2.**

### (Bonus) Action 4 — fix or delete the `RetrievalService` NotImplementedException

Not strategic, but it's a land-mine waiting to bite. Either wire it (small) or guard the call site (smaller). Mention in next commit.

---

## What to Revisit and When

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IRealtimeClient` drops `[Experimental]` (likely v11 GA, ~Nov 2026) | Pilot a "Live Conversation Practice" Korean speaking activity. Pair with adopting `ITextToSpeechClient` in the same workstream. |
| `Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData.*` drops `[Experimental]` | Re-evaluate as infrastructure for any "similar content" or "transcript search" feature. |
| Product specs a "practice more like this" or "search across my imported transcripts" feature | Pilot VectorData even if still experimental — but isolate it to non-DX24 (web/dev) until stable. |
| OpenAI .NET SDK ships first-class realtime support | Reduces Realtime adoption risk — accelerates the pilot trigger. |
| We hit observed 429s in production telemetry | Action 1 already covers this; verify the policy is doing its job. |
| We add a second TTS provider (Azure, OpenAI, or another) | `ITextToSpeechClient` immediately earns its keep. Wrap then. |
| M.E.AI ships a non-experimental rate-limit-aware middleware (genuine, not hallucinated) | Replace the Polly handler with the platform middleware — but only if it's strictly better. |

---

## Risks if We Do Nothing

If we simply file all three under "defer" and don't do Actions 1–3 either:

1. **Production resilience gap persists.** Direct-to-OpenAI traffic from DX24 has no retry. The first time OpenAI has a regional blip, the app surfaces an exception instead of recovering. Probability over 6 months: medium-high. Impact: trust damage on production device.

2. **Package drift compounds.** Each preview release of M.E.AI we skip widens the gap between pinned versions and current. The eventual upgrade becomes a multi-day yak-shave. Probability: certain. Impact: future-Zoe productivity tax.

3. **Agents.AI vs M.E.AI ambiguity calcifies.** Right now, choosing between them is reversible. After another 6 months of feature accretion, migration cost grows. Probability: medium. Impact: structural lock-in to a SKU we may not want.

4. **Realtime FOMO.** Competing language-learning apps will ship live conversation features in the next 1–2 quarters. If we wait for stability, we ship 6 months later. Mitigation: plan the pilot now (architecturally), execute fast when stable. **Action item: design doc, not code.**

5. **VectorData FOMO is lower-stakes.** Embeddings are valuable but not table-stakes. Risk of waiting: low.

6. **Hallucinated `UseRateLimitRetry` could surface again** in another AI summary. Someone less rigorous than River could ship a fix that doesn't compile. **Action item: document the verified-facts table in durable team docs so the next person doesn't re-verify.**

**Net assessment:** the "defer everything in 10.5.0" stance is correct **if and only if** we pair it with Actions 1–3. The 10.5.0 features are not the urgent risk. The naked IChatClient pipeline on the production device is.

---

## Recommendation Summary for Captain

1. **Don't ship anything from 10.5.0 itself this quarter.**
2. **Do ship Actions 1, 2, 3 this quarter** — they pay down debt that 10.5.0's marketing accidentally surfaced.
3. **Write a Realtime design doc now** (not code) so we're ready to execute when the experimental tag drops.
4. **Set a v11 GA reminder.** That's our adoption window for Realtime + TTS abstraction together.
5. **Skip `ITextToSpeechClient` wrapping.** Wait and bundle with Realtime.

# Decision: Fix Sentences content type import — zero sentence rows reaching DB

**Date:** 2025-07-24
**Author:** Wash (Backend Dev)
**Branch:** `feature/import-content`

## Problem

Jayne's Round 3 E2E Test 2: importing 3 Korean sentences with Content Type = Sentences produced +9 entries, ALL `LexicalUnitType=1` (Word), ZERO type=3 (Sentence). The same input with Content Type = Phrases worked correctly (4 phrase entries landed).

## Root Cause (S2 primary, S1 secondary)

**S2 — Primary row classification:** Line 204 always passed `LexicalUnitType.Phrase` as the hint to `ResolveLexicalUnitType`, regardless of whether the user chose Sentences or Phrases. The heuristic's early-return at line 1060 (`if classification == Phrase → return Phrase`) meant primary rows were always classified as Phrase. With Sentences harvest defaults (`harvestSentences=true, harvestWords=true, harvestPhrases=false`), the harvest filter at line 1100 dropped all Phrase-typed rows. Only Word-typed AI rows survived.

**S1 — AI prompt mismatch:** The AI extraction always used the Phrases prompt (`ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt`), which only emits Word and Phrase entries — never Sentence. River's `ExtractVocabularyFromSentences.scriban-txt` was never wired.

**S3 — DTO round-trip:** Not the cause. `ImportRow.LexicalUnitType` survives serialization; the rows simply never had Sentence classification to begin with.

## Fix

1. **Content-type-aware hint (S2):** When `effectiveContentType == ContentType.Sentences`, pass `LexicalUnitType.Sentence` as the hint. When Phrases, pass `Phrase`. Captain's directive: user's explicit content type is the strongest signal.

2. **ResolveLexicalUnitType guard:** Moved the Phrase/Sentence early-return AFTER the single-token check. Single-token terms are always Word regardless of hint. Multi-token terms trust the caller's Phrase/Sentence classification.

3. **Wire Sentences AI prompt (S1):** New `ExtractVocabularyFromSentencesAsync` method mirrors `ExtractVocabularyFromPhrasesAsync` but loads `ExtractVocabularyFromSentences.scriban-txt` and passes harvest flags (`harvest_sentences`, `harvest_phrases`, `harvest_words`) to the template.

## Tests Added

- `ParseContentAsync_Sentences_PrimaryRowsClassifiedAsSentence` — Captain's exact 3 lines with terminal periods → 3 Sentence rows.
- `ParseContentAsync_Sentences_NoPunctuation_StillClassifiedAsSentence` — Multi-token Korean without terminal period + ContentType=Sentences → still Sentence.
- `ParseContentAsync_Sentences_SingleTokenStaysWord` — Single-token "맥주" with ContentType=Sentences → stays Word.
- `ParseContentAsync_Phrases_StillWorkCorrectly` — Regression guard: Phrases content type still produces Phrase rows.

All 24 ContentImportService tests pass.

## Files Changed

- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Services/ContentImportService.cs` — primary row hint, AI prompt branching, new extraction method, heuristic fix
- `tests/SentenceStudio.UnitTests/Services/ContentImportServiceTests.cs` — 4 new tests

# Phrase/Sentence Import Gap — Import Content MVP

**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Reporter:** Jayne (Tester)  
**Branch:** `feature/import-content-mvp` (commit 04053f2)  
**Status:** ⚠️ GAP IDENTIFIED — DECISION REQUIRED

## Summary

The Import Content MVP **cannot handle paired-line phrase/sentence format** (alternating target language / native language on adjacent lines). The AI free-text fallback triggers but splits sentences into individual vocabulary words instead of preserving full phrases.

**Comma-delimited format works** as a workaround, but users must know to manually add commas between phrase pairs, and phrases get stored in the `VocabularyWord` table (semantically misleading but functionally usable).

## Test Results

### Variant 1: Paired Lines, No Delimiter ❌ BROKEN

**Input:**
```
마고는 눈하고 귀가 안 좋아요. 잘 못 보고, 잘 못 들어요.
Margo's eyes and ears are not good. (She) can't see well and can't hear well.
이 강아지는 갈색이에요. 다리가 짧아요.
This dog is brown. (Its) legs are short.
시간이 없어요. 빨리 가야 해요.
(I) don't have time. (I) need to go quickly.
```

**Parser:** Free-text AI (detected as "Free-form text (AI-extracted)")  
**Preview:** 14 individual words (눈/eye, 귀/ear, 좋다/to be good, 잘/well, 보다/to see, 듣다/to hear, etc.)  
**Commit:** 10 created, 4 skipped (dedup)  
**Database:** 14 `VocabularyWord` rows, each a single word with AI translation  

**Problems:**
- User pastes **phrases**, gets **individual words** instead
- No warning that "Vocabulary" mode doesn't support phrases
- AI badge correctly applied, but entire output is wrong
- Full sentences lost — only individual vocabulary extracted

**Verdict:** ❌ **BROKEN** — The Captain's Margo example does NOT work in MVP.

---

### Variant 2: Comma-Delimited Paired Sentences ✅ WORKS (WITH CAVEATS)

**Input:**
```
마고는 눈하고 귀가 안 좋아요. 잘 못 보고 잘 못 들어요.,Margo's eyes and ears are not good. She can't see or hear well.
이 강아지는 갈색이에요. 다리가 짧아요.,This dog is brown. Its legs are short.
시간이 없어요. 빨리 가야 해요.,I don't have time. I need to go quickly.
```

**Parser:** CSV (detected as "Comma-delimited (CSV)")  
**Preview:** 3 phrase pairs, full sentences preserved  
**Commit:** 3 created, 0 skipped  
**Database:** 3 `VocabularyWord` rows with full sentences in `TargetLanguageTerm` and `NativeLanguageTerm`

**Sample DB Row:**
```
TargetLanguageTerm: 마고는 눈하고 귀가 안 좋아요. 잘 못 보고 잘 못 들어요.
NativeLanguageTerm: Margo's eyes and ears are not good. She can't see or hear well.
```

**Problems:**
- User must know to add commas (not intuitive for paired-line phrase format)
- Still stored in `VocabularyWord` table (semantically wrong — these are sentences, not words)
- No "Phrases" content type selectable in dropdown (marked `[v2]`)
- Embedded commas in Korean text (e.g., "잘 못 보고, 잘 못 들어요") don't break CSV parsing (good)

**Verdict:** ✅ **WORKS** as workaround, but requires manual delimiter addition and stores phrases as "words"

---

## Root Cause

1. **Content Type dropdown** shows only "Vocabulary" enabled; "Phrases" disabled
2. **AI free-text fallback** (`ParseFreeTextContentAsync`) extracts individual vocabulary words, not full sentences
3. **No phrase-aware parser** exists yet — CSV path treats each row as a single "word" (which happens to contain full sentences when comma-delimited)
4. **Table schema** uses `VocabularyWord` for everything — no separate `Phrase` table (yet?)

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Enable Phrases Mode Now (Recommended)

**Effort:** Small (1-2 hours)  
**Impact:** Fixes P0 use case (Captain's Margo example)  

**Changes:**
1. Enable "Phrases" option in Content Type dropdown
2. Add phrase-specific validation: enforce 1 delimiter per line, warn on malformed input
3. Route to CSV parser (skip AI fallback)
4. Store in `VocabularyWord` table for now (schema migration deferred to post-MVP)

**Pros:**
- Unblocks paired-line phrase import (Captain's original ask)
- Clear UX: user selects "Phrases" → knows to format as paired lines or CSV
- Minimal code change (UI + routing logic)

**Cons:**
- Still stores in `VocabularyWord` table (misleading name, but functionally usable)
- Doesn't address AI fallback behavior (low priority if Phrases mode exists)

---

### Option 2: Document the Gap and Ship

**Effort:** Trivial (add warning to docs)  
**Impact:** MVP ships with limitation; users must use comma-delimited workaround

**Changes:**
1. Add help text to Import wizard: "For phrases/sentences, use comma-delimited format: `한국어 문장,English sentence`"
2. Document in user guide: "Phrase import requires comma delimiter; paired-line format not supported in MVP"
3. Note AI fallback limitation: "Free-text mode extracts individual words only"

**Pros:**
- Zero code change
- Ships MVP on schedule
- Workaround (Variant 2) already verified working

**Cons:**
- Captain's Margo example (Variant 1) doesn't work
- Poor UX — users must manually add commas
- Phrases stored as "VocabularyWord" entries (semantically wrong)

---

### Option 3: Fix AI Free-Text Path (Deferred)

**Effort:** Large (AI prompt engineering + testing)  
**Impact:** Makes Variant 1 work without commas

**Changes:**
1. Update `ParseFreeTextContentAsync` prompt to detect sentence structure
2. Preserve full sentences instead of extracting individual words
3. Add phrase-vs-vocabulary classification logic
4. Test with various phrase formats (paired lines, paragraphs, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Makes Captain's original Margo example (Variant 1) work without manual commas
- Better UX — AI infers structure automatically

**Cons:**
- Large effort (prompt engineering is unpredictable)
- AI output reliability uncertain (may still produce garbage for edge cases)
- Not P0 if Option 1 or 2 ships first

**Recommendation:** Defer to v2 or post-MVP

---

## Schema Question (Deferred)

**Current:** All content stored in `VocabularyWord` table  
**Question:** Should phrases/sentences live in separate `Phrase` table?  

**Arguments FOR separate table:**
- Clearer semantics (VocabularyWord = single words, Phrase = multi-word units)
- Enables phrase-specific features (constituent tracking, grammar rules, etc.)
- Better data integrity (constraints on word length, tokenization, etc.)

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Adds complexity (two tables to query, join logic, duplication risk)
- Current unified table works functionally (LexicalUnitType enum already distinguishes Word vs Phrase)
- Migration effort non-trivial (backfill existing data, update all queries)

**Recommendation:** Keep unified table for MVP, revisit post-launch when phrase feature set is clearer

---

## Captain's Decision Required

**Question:** Which option for MVP merge?

1. **Enable Phrases mode now** (1-2 hours, unblocks Margo example)
2. **Document gap and ship** (zero code change, Variant 2 workaround documented)
3. **Defer phrases to v2** (ship Vocabulary-only MVP)

**Jayne's Recommendation:** Option 1 (enable Phrases mode) — minimal effort, high user value, no schema change required

---

## Evidence

**Screenshots:**
- `phrase-test-variant1-preview-result.png` — Shows AI extraction of 14 individual words from 3 phrase pairs
- `phrase-test-variant2-preview.png` — Shows CSV parser preserving 3 full phrase pairs

**Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Variant 1: Individual words extracted by AI
SELECT "TargetLanguageTerm", "NativeLanguageTerm" FROM "VocabularyWord" vw
JOIN "ResourceVocabularyMapping" rvm ON rvm."VocabularyWordId" = vw."Id"
JOIN "LearningResource" lr ON rvm."ResourceId" = lr."Id"
WHERE lr."Title" = 'Phrase Import Probe - Variant 1';
-- Result: 14 rows (눈/eye, 귀/ear, 좋다/to be good, etc.)

-- Variant 2: Full phrases preserved by CSV
SELECT "TargetLanguageTerm", "NativeLanguageTerm" FROM "VocabularyWord" vw
JOIN "ResourceVocabularyMapping" rvm ON rvm."VocabularyWordId" = vw."Id"
JOIN "LearningResource" lr ON rvm."ResourceId" = lr."Id"
WHERE lr."Title" = 'Phrase Import Probe - Variant 2';
-- Result: 3 rows (full sentences in both columns)
```

**Aspire Logs:**
- Variant 1: "Detected Free-form text (AI-extracted), 14 rows"
- Variant 2: "Detected Comma-delimited (CSV), 3 rows"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Captain reviews** this report
2. **Captain decides** Option 1, 2, or 3
3. If Option 1: Kaylee implements Phrases mode (small task)
4. If Option 2: Scribe documents limitation in user guide
5. If Option 3: Squad closes this issue, reopens post-MVP

### 2026-04-25: Jayne — v1.1 Import Test Matrix Authored

**By:** Jayne (Tester) via Squad  
**What:** Test matrix for v1.1 import features authored and ready to execute once Wash + Kaylee complete implementation.

## Matrix Summary

| ID | Scenario | Priority | Covers |
|----|----------|----------|--------|
| A | Vocabulary CSV regression | P0 | v1.0 still works, LexicalUnitType=1 |
| B | Phrases import (Korean) | P0 | Words + Phrases created, Captain's Margo example |
| C | Transcript import (prose) | P0 | LearningResource.Transcript populated, Words primarily |
| D | Auto-detect high confidence | P1 | >=0.85 auto-routes, banner + [Change] |
| E | Auto-detect medium confidence | P1 | 0.70-0.84 forces confirmation, no premature DB writes |
| F | Auto-detect low confidence | P1 | <0.70 shows manual picker, no auto-routing |
| G | Checkbox zero-checked | P1 | Validation blocks advance |
| H | Checkbox override multiple | P1 | Transcript + Phrases + Words all honored |
| I | Confidence gate pollution | P0 | Cancel produces ZERO new DB rows |
| J | Backfill migration | P0 | Space heuristic, zero Unknown remaining |

**Edge cases (7):** Empty input, >30KB, Korean-only, mixed language, zero extraction, duplicate import, special characters.

**Fixtures (5):** phrase-list-korean.txt, transcript-korean.txt, vocab-csv.csv, ambiguous-blob.txt, low-confidence-noise.txt.

## Gaps Flagged

1. **Zero-vocab extraction behavior undefined.** Captain's confirms-d2 notes this is an open sub-question ("rollback the resource, or keep and warn"). Wash must decide and document; I'll update Edge 5 accordingly.

2. **>30KB handling unclear.** Zoe deferred chunking to v1.2; v1.1 "currently rejects." Wash needs to implement the rejection message. If chunking lands in v1.1 instead, Edge 2 must be rewritten.

3. **Auto-detect confidence thresholds are classifier-dependent.** The fixtures I authored (ambiguous-blob.txt, low-confidence-noise.txt) are designed to hit medium/low bands, but actual confidence scores depend on River's classifier prompt. If the classifier returns unexpected confidence for these inputs, fixtures may need tuning.

4. **Checkbox UI exact rendering unknown.** Kaylee's Blazor implementation will determine exact element selectors, CSS classes, and interaction patterns. Playwright steps will need selector updates once the UI lands.

5. **Transcript fixture size.** The transcript-korean.txt fixture is ~440 bytes — well under the 30KB limit. This is intentional for Scenario C. The >30KB test (Edge 2) will need a generated blob at runtime.

## Status

All 10 scenarios + 7 edge cases + 5 fixtures: **AUTHORED, NOT YET RUN.**  
Execution blocked on Wash (backend) + Kaylee (UI) completing v1.1 implementation.

# Kaylee v1.1 UI — Import Content Harvest Checkboxes + Auto-detect Banner

**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Author:** Kaylee (Full-stack Dev)  
**Branch:** `feature/import-content-mvp`  
**Status:** Implemented, awaiting Wash backend integration + Jayne e2e

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed v2 disabled state
Lines 104-107 of the old ImportContent.razor had Phrases, Transcript, and Auto-detect options disabled with `<span class="badge bg-secondary ms-1">v2</span>`. All three are now fully enabled in the content type dropdown.

### 2. Harvest checkbox step (Captain's directive)
Replaced the implicit single-pick content-type-determines-harvest model with three independent checkboxes:

- **This is a Transcript** — stores full text on the learning resource
- **Harvest Phrases** — extracts phrase-level entries (LexicalUnitType=Phrase)
- **Harvest Words** — extracts individual vocabulary words (LexicalUnitType=Word)

**Validation:** At least one checkbox must be checked. Inline `alert-danger` displayed if user attempts to commit with all unchecked. Also validated via toast on commit attempt.

**Default presets by scenario:**

| User picks / Auto-detects | Transcript | Phrases | Words |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vocabulary | off | off | ON |
| Phrases | off | ON | ON |
| Transcript | ON | off | ON |
| Auto-detect | set from classifier result | | |

User can override any combination after defaults are applied.

### 3. Auto-detect confidence banner (D3)
Added a three-tier confidence gate that runs BEFORE any DB persistence:

- **High (>=85%):** `alert-info` banner with `bi-stars` icon showing detected type + percentage. [Change] button opens type chooser overlay. Preview runs immediately.
- **Medium (70-84%):** `alert-warning` banner asking user to confirm or pick a different type. Preview is gated — won't run until user confirms or overrides.
- **Low (<70%):** `alert-secondary` banner with "Couldn't auto-detect" message. Three manual type buttons (Vocabulary/Phrases/Transcript). Classifier hint shown as soft suggestion. Preview is gated.

The [Change] action re-opens a type picker card with the current detection pre-selected via highlighted button state.

### 4. Display polish
- All Bootstrap classes (`form-check`, `btn`, `alert`, `badge`)
- Confidence displayed as percentage (industry-standard, Captain didn't specify otherwise)
- No emojis anywhere — `bi-stars`, `bi-pencil`, `bi-check-lg`, `bi-question-circle`, `bi-exclamation-circle`, `bi-exclamation-triangle-fill` only
- Clear, friendly copy throughout

### 5. Backend contract assumptions (for Wash)
Added three boolean fields to `ContentImportCommit` DTO:

```csharp
public bool HarvestTranscript { get; set; }
public bool HarvestPhrases { get; set; }
public bool HarvestWords { get; set; } = true;  // default: always harvest words
```

**Wash integration notes:**
- `CommitImportAsync` should read these three booleans to determine what to persist
- When `HarvestTranscript=true`, store `rawText` in `LearningResource.Transcript` and set `MediaType="Transcript"`
- When `HarvestPhrases=true`, create VocabularyWord rows with `LexicalUnitType=Phrase`
- When `HarvestWords=true`, create VocabularyWord rows with `LexicalUnitType=Word`
- The existing `DetectContentType()` method returns `ContentTypeDetectionResult` with `ContentType`, `Confidence`, `Note` — unchanged

### 6. ImportStep enum change
Added `Harvest` step between `Source` and `Preview`:
```csharp
enum ImportStep { Source, Harvest, Preview, Commit, Complete }
```

---

## Known limitations
- The `DetectContentType()` method is currently a stub that always returns Vocabulary with 1.0 confidence. River's classifier prompt needs to be wired in for the auto-detect path to be truly functional.
- Pre-existing build errors from missing `ContentClassificationResult` type (River/Wash parallel work) prevent a full build. My Razor file compiles clean — no Razor-specific errors.
- Harvest checkbox labels are hardcoded English. Localization keys should be added in a follow-up pass.

### 2026-04-25: River — v1.1 prompt deliverables

**By:** River (AI/Prompt Engineer) via Squad
**Scope:** Data Import v1.1 prompt work — three prompts authored/revised per Captain's directives.

---

#### 1. ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt (NEW)

**File:** `src/SentenceStudio.AppLib/Resources/Raw/ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt`

**Template variables:** `{{ content }}`, `{{ format_hint }}` (optional)

**Response DTO needed:** A new `ImportContentClassificationResponse` with fields:
- `type` (string: "Vocabulary" | "Phrases" | "Transcript")
- `confidence` (float: 0.0-1.0)
- `reasoning` (string)
- `signals` (string array)

**Continuity heuristic (Captain's directive):** Given HIGHEST WEIGHT in the classification procedure. The prompt instructs the LLM to read 5-10 consecutive lines and determine whether they form flowing narrative (Transcript) or stand alone with no shared referents (Phrases). This is step 3 of 5 in the procedure, but explicitly labeled as highest weight. The few-shot examples demonstrate the heuristic in action — the Phrases example shows topic shifts between lines, the Transcript example traces anaphoric references across sentences.

**Confidence calibration:**
- >= 0.85: clear single type (auto-proceed)
- 0.70-0.84: borderline (show confirmation UI)
- < 0.70: ambiguous (manual selection fallback)

**Few-shot examples included:**
1. Korean vocabulary (tab-delimited CSV shape) → Vocabulary, 0.95
2. Korean phrase list (Captain's Margo example + others) → Phrases, 0.88
3. Korean transcript (prose about Korean food/kimchi) → Transcript, 0.93

---

#### 2. ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt (REVISED)

**File:** `src/SentenceStudio.AppLib/Resources/Raw/ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt`

**Changes:**
- **Word-biased extraction** per Captain's harvest model: prompt now says "aim for 90%+ Word-type entries" and marks Phrase as "RARE — only for genuinely fixed multi-word expressions."
- **Dropped Sentence type** from transcript extraction — the response format now only accepts "Word | Phrase" (not "Word | Phrase | Sentence"). Transcripts harvest words, not sentences.
- Removed the old Sentence classification section entirely. The LexicalUnitType=Sentence concept still exists in the enum and in FreeTextToVocab, but transcript extraction no longer produces them.
- **Generalized system role** — changed hardcoded "Korean" to `{{ target_language }}` for language-agnostic use.
- Common verb-object pairs (비가 오다, 시간이 없다) are now explicitly excluded from Phrase classification — extract verb and noun as separate Words instead.
- Added final IMPORTANT reminder: "Word-bias reminder: aim for 90%+ Word entries."

**Reachability from generic pipeline:** The template uses `{{ transcript }}`, `{{ video_title }}`, `{{ channel_name }}` variables. The YouTube-specific variables (`video_title`, `channel_name`) are already wrapped in `{{ if }}` guards, so they gracefully degrade to empty when called from the generic ContentImportService pipeline. **No plumbing change needed** — Wash can call this template from ContentImportService by passing `transcript = content` and leaving `video_title`/`channel_name` null. The existing `_fileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt")` pattern works identically.

---

#### 3. ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt (NEW)

**File:** `src/SentenceStudio.AppLib/Resources/Raw/ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt`

**Template variables:** `{{ source_text }}`, `{{ target_language }}`, `{{ native_language }}`, `{{ existing_terms }}` (optional), `{{ topik_level }}` (optional)

**Response DTO:** Can reuse `FreeTextVocabularyExtractionResponse` — same shape (vocabulary array with confidence, notes, partOfSpeech, lexicalUnitType, relatedTerms). No new DTO needed.

**Extraction strategy:** Produces BOTH Word and Phrase entries per Captain's directive:
- Phrase entries: core expressions normalized to dictionary form, with relatedTerms populated
- Word entries: individual content words extracted from the phrases
- Deduplication across lines, but a word AND a phrase containing it both appear (they serve different learning purposes)

**Captain's test case handled:** "마고는 눈하고 귀가 안 좋아요. 잘 못 보고, 잘 못 들어요." — the worked example in the prompt explicitly demonstrates extracting "눈이 안 좋다", "귀가 안 좋다", "잘 못 보다", "잘 못 듣다" as phrases, plus "눈", "귀", "보다", "듣다", "좋다" as individual words.

---

#### 4. AiService pipeline reachability (read-only consult)

**AiService.SendPrompt<T>()** is fully generic — it takes a rendered string prompt and deserializes into any DTO. No new methods needed.

**What Wash needs to plumb:**

1. **ClassifyImportContent:** Add a method in ContentImportService (or upgrade `DetectContentType`) that:
   - Loads `ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt`
   - Renders with `{ content, format_hint }`
   - Calls `SendPrompt<ImportContentClassificationResponse>(prompt)`
   - A new `ImportContentClassificationResponse` DTO is needed (type, confidence, reasoning, signals)

2. **ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases:** Add a method (parallel to `ParseFreeTextContentAsync`) that:
   - Loads `ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt`
   - Renders with `{ source_text, target_language, native_language, existing_terms, topik_level }`
   - Calls `SendPrompt<FreeTextVocabularyExtractionResponse>(prompt)` — reuses existing DTO
   - Remove the `NotSupportedException("Phrase import is not yet supported")` guard in ParseContentAsync

3. **ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript (generic path):** Add a transcript parsing method that:
   - Loads `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt` (same template used by VideoImportPipelineService)
   - Passes `transcript = content`, `video_title = null`, `channel_name = null`
   - Calls `SendPrompt<VocabularyExtractionResponse>(prompt)`
   - Remove the `NotSupportedException("Transcript import is not yet supported")` guard

**No AiService changes needed.** All three prompts work through the existing `SendPrompt<T>()` pipeline.

---

**Status:** All three prompts authored and ready for integration. Wash owns the plumbing.

### 2026-04-25T13:34Z: Captain confirms checkbox UX in v1.1

**By:** David (Captain), via Squad
**What:** v1.1 import wizard ships independent checkboxes for content harvesting:
- ☐ This is a Transcript (store full text on LearningResource.Transcript, MediaType="Transcript")
- ☐ Harvest Phrases (LexicalUnitType=Phrase entries)
- ☐ Harvest Words (LexicalUnitType=Word entries)

This replaces the radio-button content-type selector. Decouples "what is this content" from "what do I want extracted."

**Default checkbox states by detected/selected scenario** (Kaylee + River to design):
- User selects/auto-detects "Vocabulary": ☐ Transcript, ☐ Phrases, ☑ Words
- User selects/auto-detects "Phrases": ☐ Transcript, ☑ Phrases, ☑ Words
- User selects/auto-detects "Transcript": ☑ Transcript, ☐ Phrases, ☑ Words
- User can override any combination before commit.

**Open follow-up:** validation rule — at least one harvest checkbox (Phrases or Words) must be checked, OR Transcript must be checked. All-unchecked is invalid.

**Status:** Decisions #2, #3, and checkbox UX confirmed. #1 LexicalUnitType (Zoe-corrected, no new enum) and #4 branch strategy still pending.

---


### 2026-04-25: Captain confirms D1 — LexicalUnitType backfill (heuristic)

**By:** Captain (David Ortinau) via Squad
**What:** Backfill assumption + migration validation gate for v1.1.

**Decisions:**

1. **Backfill heuristic, NOT blanket assignment.** When the `SetDefaultLexicalUnitType` migration runs against existing `VocabularyWord` rows where `LexicalUnitType = 0` (Unknown):
   - **If the term contains a space** → assign `LexicalUnitType = 2` (Phrase)
   - **Otherwise** → assign `LexicalUnitType = 1` (Word)
   - Korean terms with spaces (e.g., "잘 못 들어요") will correctly become Phrase entries.
   - Single-token Korean words (e.g., "마고") will correctly become Word entries.
   - Edge case to watch: terms with leading/trailing whitespace — migration should `TRIM` before checking for space, OR we accept the rare false positive.

2. **Migration validation gate ENFORCED.** Per repo's standing rule (`scripts/validate-mobile-migrations.sh`), Wash MUST run the validation script after generating the migration and BEFORE the v1.1 PR opens. If the script fails, Wash fixes the migration — no deploy until green.

**Implementation note for Wash:**
```sql
-- The Up() body should look something like:
UPDATE VocabularyWords 
SET LexicalUnitType = CASE 
  WHEN INSTR(TRIM(Term), ' ') > 0 THEN 2  -- Phrase
  ELSE 1                                   -- Word
END
WHERE LexicalUnitType = 0;
```

But: **never hand-write the migration**. Use `dotnet ef migrations add SetDefaultLexicalUnitType` to scaffold, then edit the `Up()` body in the generated file to perform the heuristic UPDATE. EF will generate the schema-side scaffolding correctly; the data backfill SQL we author inside the generated file.

**Down() migration:** safe — no-op or leave the values as-is (downgrading shouldn't reset LexicalUnitType to Unknown; that would be data loss).

---


### 2026-04-25T13:01Z: Captain confirms Decision #2 (transcripts) — Option C

**By:** David (Captain), via Squad
**Decision:** Transcript imports persist BOTH the full text on `LearningResource.Transcript` AND run `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript` to harvest VocabularyWord rows mapped via ResourceVocabularyMapping.
**Rationale:** A transcript is dual-purpose — readable source material plus a vocab/phrase mine for study. Storing only one forces a re-import for the other. All required pieces (Transcript field, MediaType="Transcript", ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript prompt) already exist; v1.1 wires the existing extraction prompt into the generic ContentImportService pipeline.
**Open sub-questions still outstanding:**
- Chunking strategy for transcripts >50KB (Zoe deferred to v1.2; v1.1 currently rejects). Captain to confirm.
- Behavior on zero-vocab extraction: rollback the resource, or keep the transcript and surface a warning. Captain to confirm.
- River must verify `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript` is reachable from the generic pipeline (not just YouTube path).
**Status:** Decision #2 confirmed. Decisions #1, #3, #4 still pending Captain confirmation. Implementation remains gated.

---


### 2026-04-25: Captain confirms D4 — single branch, ship when complete

**By:** Captain (David Ortinau) via Squad
**What:** Branch strategy for v1.1 import work — Option A confirmed.
**Why:** "There's no reason to ship this until it's right." Captain prefers a complete, polished feature over partial v1.0 in production.

**Decision:**
- Continue v1.1 work on `feature/import-content-mvp` branch (do NOT push v1.0 yet, do NOT cut a v1.1 branch from main).
- Build phrases, transcripts, auto-detect, and checkbox harvest UX on top of the existing v1.0 commits.
- Before opening the final PR, rename the branch: `feature/import-content-mvp` → `feature/import-content` (drop the `-mvp` suffix — feature is no longer "minimum").
- Single PR encompassing v1.0 + v1.1. Title: *"Data Import: text/file/CSV import with auto-detect, phrases, transcripts, and vocabulary harvest"*.

**Implications:**
- v1.0 remains unmerged during v1.1 work — that's fine, Captain's call.
- PR will be larger (~1500+ lines) — Captain accepts the review burden in exchange for shipping a complete feature.
- Reviewers (and Captain's `/review` gate) get one cohesive review of the full import surface, not two scoped passes.
- No production exposure of partial functionality — users get the full Vocabulary/Phrases/Transcript/Auto-detect experience on day one.

**Branch rename happens at PR-open time**, not now. While v1.1 is in flight, branch stays `feature/import-content-mvp` so existing tooling, checkpoints, and references don't break.

---


### 2026-04-25T13:19Z: Captain refines harvest model + confirms Decision #3

**By:** David (Captain), via Squad
**What:** The import type the user picks determines what gets harvested into VocabularyWord rows:

| User picks | Harvests | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Vocabulary** | Words only (LexicalUnitType=Word) | Pure vocab list import |
| **Phrases** | Both Words AND Phrases (LexicalUnitType=Word + Phrase) | User input is standalone sentences with no sentence-to-sentence continuity |
| **Transcript** | Words primarily (not phrases in most cases) | Continuous prose; phrase extraction is the wrong tool here |

**Phrase-vs-Transcript classifier signal (CRITICAL for auto-detect):**
"Phrases" content = standalone sentences with NO continuity sentence-to-sentence. Each sentence stands alone. If you read it as a passage, it doesn't flow. The classifier prompt must check for continuity — if continuity exists, it's a Transcript; if missing, it's a Phrase list.

**Decision #3 (auto-detect confidence gate): CONFIRMED.**
River's three-tier model + always-visible banner + override before commit is approved. Confidence gate must run before any DB persistence — Captain's words: "have the user confirm before the import potentially pollutes the database."

**Decision #2 adjustment (transcripts):**
Previous: "run ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript to harvest vocab/phrases."
Corrected: "run ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript to harvest vocabulary WORDS primarily, not phrases." Phrase extraction from prose is the wrong tool. River's prompt may need adjustment to bias toward Word-type extraction when MediaType=Transcript.

**Open UX enhancement (Captain raised optionally):**
Independent checkboxes on the import wizard: ☐ Transcript ☐ Phrase ☐ Word — let the user explicitly state what they expect the import to harvest, instead of inferring from a single content-type radio. This decouples "what is this content" from "what do I want extracted." Captain to confirm: ship checkboxes in v1.1, or stick with radio-button content-type and ship checkboxes in v1.2?

**Status:** Decisions #2 (refined) and #3 confirmed. Decision #4 (branch) and the checkbox UX question still pending.

# Wash v1.1 Backend Implementation

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Author:** Wash (Backend Dev)
**Branch:** `feature/import-content-mvp`

## Migration: SetDefaultLexicalUnitType

- **File:** `20260425134549_SetDefaultLexicalUnitType.cs` (both Postgres and SQLite variants)
- **Purpose:** Heuristic backfill of existing Unknown (0) LexicalUnitType entries
- **Logic:** `TRIM(TargetLanguageTerm)` checked for space → Phrase (2), else Word (1)
- **Down():** No-op (Captain D1: resetting to Unknown = data loss)
- **Postgres SQL:** Uses `POSITION(' ' IN TRIM("TargetLanguageTerm"))` with quoted identifiers
- **SQLite SQL:** Uses `INSTR(TRIM(TargetLanguageTerm), ' ')` with bare identifiers
- **Build verification:** Shared (net10.0), MacCatalyst (net10.0-maccatalyst), API all pass
- **validate-mobile-migrations.sh:** Requires running app + maui devflow — deferred to Captain's manual gate (script requires interactive device connection)

## ContentImportService v1.1 Branch Summary

### Phrase Branch
- Routes through existing `FreeTextToVocab.scriban-txt` which already classifies LexicalUnitType per entry
- Harvest both Words AND Phrases per Captain's harvest matrix
- TODO: Replace with River's dedicated `ExtractPhrasesFromContent.scriban-txt` when available
- Filters results by harvest checkbox flags (harvestWords, harvestPhrases)

### Transcript Branch
- Stores full text on `LearningResource.Transcript`, sets `MediaType="Transcript"`
- Extracts vocabulary using existing `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt`
- Word-biased extraction per Captain's D2 refinement
- Respects harvest checkboxes independently

### Auto-detect Branch
- AI classification prompt built inline (River's `ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt` not yet landed)
- Three-tier confidence gate (Captain D3):
  - >= 0.85: auto-route, no user confirmation
  - 0.70-0.84: return to UI for user confirmation, no DB writes
  - < 0.70: return to UI, user must pick manually
- Classification runs BEFORE any DB persistence (Captain's directive)
- `ContentClassificationResult` DTO carries type, confidence, reasoning, and signals

### Checkbox Harvest Model (DTO contract)
- `ContentImportRequest` gains: `HarvestTranscript`, `HarvestPhrases`, `HarvestWords` booleans
- `ContentImportCommit` gains: same three booleans + `TranscriptText` string
- Backend validates at least one must be true
- `ImportRow` gains `LexicalUnitType` field for per-row classification
- `ContentImportPreview` gains `Classification` and `RequiresUserConfirmation` fields

## Edge Case Decisions

### Zero-vocab extraction
**Decision:** Persist the LearningResource (if transcript was requested) with empty vocab set + clear warning message. Do NOT silently succeed and do NOT error/rollback.
**Rationale:** A transcript is valuable even without extracted vocab. The user explicitly asked for transcript storage. Surfacing a warning lets UI show "Transcript stored, no vocabulary extracted" which is truthful and actionable.

### Transcript chunking >30KB
**Decision:** Reject with clear error message. Limit is 30KB (not the original 50KB) for transcript extraction because LLM context windows work better with shorter inputs.
**Rationale:** Captain hasn't decided on chunking strategy. v1.1 processes the whole text in one prompt up to 30KB. Anything larger gets a clear rejection message pointing to v1.2 chunking support.
**Follow-up:** v1.2 should implement sliding-window or semantic chunking with merge-dedup.

## Blockers Waiting on River
1. `ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt` — using inline prompt as bridge; replace when River lands it
2. `ExtractPhrasesFromContent.scriban-txt` — using FreeTextToVocab as bridge (it already classifies LexicalUnitType)
3. River's transcript prompt word-bias adjustment — current `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript.scriban-txt` already handles LexicalUnitType; may need refinement to suppress Phrase extraction for transcript context

## Files Changed
- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Migrations/20260425134549_SetDefaultLexicalUnitType.cs` (new)
- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Migrations/20260425134549_SetDefaultLexicalUnitType.Designer.cs` (new)
- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Migrations/Sqlite/20260425134549_SetDefaultLexicalUnitType.cs` (new)
- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Migrations/Sqlite/20260425134549_SetDefaultLexicalUnitType.Designer.cs` (new)
- `src/SentenceStudio.Shared/Services/ContentImportService.cs` (updated)
- `src/SentenceStudio.UI/Pages/ImportContent.razor` (updated — adapted DetectContentType → ClassifyContentAsync)

# Simon — v1.1 Data Import Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Author:** Simon (Backend Specialist, Escalation)  
**Trigger:** Jayne's DO-NOT-SHIP rejection of v1.1 Data Import  
**Artifact:** `ContentImportService.cs` (surgical edits only)

## BUG-2 (P0): Transcript text never stored

**Root cause:** The UI constructs `ContentImportCommit` but never sets `TranscriptText`. The service checked `commit.TranscriptText` (always null) when deciding what to persist on `LearningResource.Transcript`. The DTO field existed but the UI had no access to the original raw text at commit time because the preview didn't carry it.

**Fix:** Added `SourceText` property to `ContentImportPreview`. All four parse return paths now set `SourceText = content`. In `CommitImportAsync`, the transcript text resolves as: `commit.TranscriptText ?? commit.Preview.SourceText`. This round-trips the original text through the preview without requiring UI changes.

**Lines changed:**
- `ContentImportPreview.SourceText` — new property (DTO section)
- 4x `return new ContentImportPreview { ... SourceText = content }` in `ParseContentAsync`
- `CommitImportAsync` — `transcriptText` variable with fallback logic, used in both new-resource and existing-resource transcript assignment

## BUG-1 (P1): NULL UserProfileId on every imported LearningResource

**Root cause:** `CommitImportAsync` bypasses `LearningResourceRepository.SaveAsync()` and writes directly to `ApplicationDbContext`. The repo's `ActiveUserId` assignment (`resource.UserProfileId ??= ActiveUserId`) never fires during import. The service had no reference to `IPreferencesService` and no concept of the current user.

**Fix:** Injected `IPreferencesService` into `ContentImportService` constructor (matching the pattern in `LearningResourceRepository`). Added `ActiveUserId` property. In `CommitImportAsync`, resolved `userId` and set `UserProfileId` on both new resources and orphaned existing resources.

**Lines changed:**
- Constructor: added `_preferences` field + `ActiveUserId` property
- New resource creation: `UserProfileId = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(userId) ? userId : null`
- Existing resource path: defensive backfill if `targetResource.UserProfileId` is null

## BUG-3 (P1): LexicalUnitType wrong on imported phrases

**Root cause:** `ParseFreeTextContentAsync` (the Phrases branch AI extraction) created `ImportRow` objects without mapping `item.LexicalUnitType` from the AI response DTO. The `ImportRow.LexicalUnitType` defaulted to `Word` (the default in the DTO). The AI was correctly classifying multi-word terms as Phrase, but the classification was silently dropped during row conversion.

**Fix (two layers):**
1. **Mapping fix:** Added `LexicalUnitType = ResolveLexicalUnitType(item.LexicalUnitType, item.TargetLanguageTerm)` to all three row-creation sites (free-text, transcript, CSV/delimited).
2. **Defensive heuristic (`ResolveLexicalUnitType`):** If the AI classified a multi-word term (contains space) as `Word` or `Unknown`, the heuristic reclassifies it as `Phrase`. Matches the migration backfill heuristic and Captain's explicit approval.

**Lines changed:**
- New static method `ResolveLexicalUnitType(LexicalUnitType, string?)`
- `ParseFreeTextContentAsync` ImportRow creation: added `LexicalUnitType` mapping
- `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscriptAsync` ImportRow creation: wrapped with heuristic
- `ParseDelimitedContent` ImportRow creation: added heuristic for CSV imports

# Jayne v1.1 Import Retest - Verdict

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Tester:** Jayne (Squad QA)  
**Branch:** `feature/import-content-mvp`

## Verdict: CONDITIONAL SHIP

### Conditions

1. **MUST commit Jayne's frontend fix** (`ImportContent.razor`) alongside Simon's backend fixes (`ContentImportService.cs`). Without the frontend fix, BUG-3 (LexicalUnitType) remains broken despite the backend being correct.

2. Both files are currently uncommitted working-tree changes. They should be committed together in a single commit (or two clearly linked commits) before merge.

## What Changed Since Prior DO-NOT-SHIP Verdict

| Prior Verdict | Retest Result |
|---------------|---------------|
| BUG-1 (P1): NULL UserProfileId | FIXED -- Simon's backend fix verified in 4 scenarios |
| BUG-2 (P0): Transcript never stored | FIXED -- Simon's backend + Jayne's frontend fix verified in 2 scenarios |
| BUG-3 (P1): Wrong LexicalUnitType | FIXED -- Simon's backend + Jayne's frontend fix verified with targeted multi-word phrase test |

## New Issue Found During Retest

**Frontend data-loss bug in `ImportContent.razor`:**
- The Blazor frontend was dropping `LexicalUnitType` and `SourceText` during the preview-to-commit round-trip
- This was the TRUE root cause of BUG-3 persisting despite Simon's correct backend heuristic
- Fixed by Kaylee (2 lines added)
- No separate bug filed -- included in this retest as part of the same fix batch

## Scenarios Tested

| Scenario | Result | Bugs Verified |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| A: Vocabulary CSV Regression | PASS | BUG-1 |
| B: Korean Phrases (Margo) | PASS (with dedup caveat) | BUG-1 |
| BUG-3 Targeted (v3) | PASS | BUG-3 |
| C: Transcript Prose | PASS | BUG-1, BUG-2 |
| H: Checkbox Override + Transcript | PASS | BUG-1, BUG-2, checkbox override |

# Kaylee -- v1.1 ImportContent.razor DTO Mapping Fix

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Author:** Kaylee (Full-stack Dev)  
**Trigger:** Jayne's retest verdict identified two frontend omissions that nullified Simon's backend fixes for BUG-2 and BUG-3.

## Fields Mapped

### 1. `LexicalUnitType` on editableRows construction (~line 688)

- **DTO:** `ImportRow.LexicalUnitType` (enum, defaults to `Word`)
- **Problem:** When converting `previewResult.Rows` into editable `ImportRow` objects for the preview table, `LexicalUnitType` was not included in the object initializer. Every row silently defaulted to `Word`, discarding Simon's backend classification from `ResolveLexicalUnitType`.
- **Fix:** Added `LexicalUnitType = r.LexicalUnitType` to the initializer block.
- **Impact:** Fixes BUG-3 (multi-word phrases stored as Word).

### 2. `SourceText` on updatedPreview construction (~line 853)

- **DTO:** `ContentImportPreview.SourceText` (string?, carries original raw text)
- **Problem:** When building the `ContentImportPreview` for the commit DTO, `SourceText` was not copied from the original `previewResult`. Simon's backend falls back to `commit.Preview.SourceText` when `commit.TranscriptText` is null (BUG-2 fix), but the frontend was sending `SourceText = null`.
- **Fix:** Added `SourceText = previewResult.SourceText` to the initializer block.
- **Impact:** Fixes BUG-2 (transcript text never stored).

## Audit of Adjacent Fields

I reviewed ALL properties on each DTO for completeness:

### ImportRow (8 properties)
All 8 properties are now mapped in the editableRows construction:
RowNumber, TargetLanguageTerm, NativeLanguageTerm, Status, Error, IsSelected, IsAiTranslated, LexicalUnitType.

### ContentImportPreview (7 properties)
5 of 7 are mapped in updatedPreview. The two unmapped:
- `Classification` -- informational only; not read by `CommitImportAsync`. No fix needed.
- `RequiresUserConfirmation` -- UI-only gate flag; not read during commit. No fix needed.

### ContentImportCommit (7 properties)
All 7 are set: Preview, Target, DedupMode, HarvestTranscript, HarvestPhrases, HarvestWords.
`TranscriptText` is intentionally left null -- Simon's backend resolves it from `Preview.SourceText` via the fallback chain.

## Build Status

# v1.1 Import Content — DO-NOT-SHIP (Initial)

**Author:** Jayne (Tester)  
**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Status:** RESOLVED (see final verdict above)

## Decision (Superseded)

Initial DO-NOT-SHIP verdict from first e2e run. This decision is now archived as reference; see final verdict (2026-04-27 SHIP) for resolution.

**3 bugs blocked release:**

1. **BUG-2 (P0):** Transcript text never stored on LearningResource despite checkbox being checked. Core feature broken.
2. **BUG-1 (P1):** All imported LearningResources have NULL UserProfileId. Resources are orphaned.
3. **BUG-3 (P1):** Multi-word phrases stored as LexicalUnitType=1 (Word) instead of 2 (Phrase). Classification broken during import.

All three bugs were fixed in the follow-up cycle (Simon backend + Kaylee frontend) and verified passing in final sweep.

# v1.2: Phrase-Save Bug Root Cause & Sentence Type Expansion

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Authors:** Wash (Backend Dev), River (AI/Prompt Engineer), Kaylee (Full-stack Dev), Jayne (Tester)  
**Branch:** `feature/import-content`  
**Status:** ✅ **ROUND 1 COMPLETE** — Code ready; Round 2 UI pending

## Root Cause Analysis

The v1.1 phrase-save bug was caused by the Phrases branch in `ContentImportService.cs` (line ~192) calling `ParseFreeTextContentAsync()`, which used the generic `FreeTextToVocab.scriban-txt` prompt. This prompt decomposes any input into individual vocabulary words, discarding phrase/sentence structure entirely.

**Root Cause**: River's dedicated `ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt` had been written and deployed to Raw resources, but was **never wired in**. A TODO comment at line 191 acknowledged this: "Use River's dedicated phrase extraction prompt when it lands."

**Evidence**: Jayne reproduced Captain's exact scenario (3 Korean|English sentences) and confirmed: 3 inputs → 8 individual words, ZERO phrase entries. All entries had `LexicalUnitType=1 (Word)`, confirming generic prompt usage.

## Fix: Two-Step Phrase Pipeline

Wash rewrote the Phrases branch to:

1. **Parse delimited content first** (pipe/CSV/TSV) → create primary phrase/sentence entries preserving user's original content
2. **Run River's dedicated AI prompt** → harvest constituent words from each phrase
3. **Combine both sets** → apply deduplication by target term
4. **Filter by harvest flags** → respect `HarvestPhrases`, `HarvestWords`, `HarvestSentences` selections

This ensures the 3 original pipe-delimited sentences are always present in the preview AND commit, with constituent words added as a bonus extraction.

## New: ContentType.Sentences

Added `ContentType.Sentences` enum value for complete grammatical sentences. Routes to the same import pipeline as Phrases, but `ResolveLexicalUnitType` heuristic classifies entries based on terminal punctuation:

```
1. If AI classified as Phrase or Sentence → keep it
2. If no whitespace → Word
3. If whitespace + terminal punctuation (. ! ? 。 ！ ？) → Sentence
4. If whitespace + no terminal punctuation → Phrase
```

This replaces the v1.1 "contains space → Phrase" heuristic. Terminal punctuation is the reliable signal for complete sentences.

## DTO Changes

### ContentType enum (added)
```csharp
[Description("Complete grammatical sentences")]
Sentences,
```

### ContentImportRequest (added)
```csharp
bool HarvestSentences  // Extract Sentence-type entries
```

### ContentImportCommit (added)
```csharp
bool HarvestSentences
```

## JSON Response Contract (River)

All three extraction prompts (`ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases`, `ExtractVocabularyFromSentences`, `ExtractVocabularyFromTranscript`) return identical shape:

```json
{
  "vocabulary": [
    {
      "targetLanguageTerm": "string",
      "nativeLanguageTerm": "string",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low",
      "notes": "string?",
      "partOfSpeech": "noun | verb | adjective | ...",
      "topikLevel": 3,
      "lexicalUnitType": "Word | Phrase | Sentence",
      "relatedTerms": ["string"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Classifier**: `ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt` now returns four types: `"Vocabulary"`, `"Phrases"`, `"Sentences"`, `"Transcript"`.

## No Schema Migration

- `LexicalUnitType.Sentence = 3` already exists in database
- No new columns, tables, or migrations required
- `ContentType` is DTO-only (not persisted)

## UI Changes (Kaylee, Round 1)

**Vocabulary.razor:**
- Added Type filter dropdown to desktop filter row (All/Word/Phrase/Sentence)
- Mirrored dropdown to mobile offcanvas for consistency
- Pattern matches existing filters (Association, Status, Encoding)
- Unknown type excluded from filter options (fallback classification only)

**VocabularyWordEdit.razor:** No changes needed — already supports all three types.

**Round 2 Scope (Pending):**
- Add "Sentences" button to import content type selector
- Add "Sentences" harvest checkbox
- Update `ContentTypeToString` helper

## Test Status

- **Build:** Green (610 tests passing in Shared)
- **Reproduction:** ✅ Bug confirmed by Jayne at HEAD 3b6c01b
- **Round 2 Plan:** 7-section test plan (Phrases/Sentences/Transcript + edge cases) in `e2e-testing-workspace/v12-import-bug/test-plan.md`

## Files Modified

- `ContentImportService.cs` — Rewrote Phrases/Sentences branches, heuristic refinement
- `ContentImportServiceTests.cs` — Updated tests, fixed stale test assertions
- `ExtractVocabularyFromPhrases.scriban-txt` — Added harvest flags + pipe handling
- `ExtractVocabularyFromSentences.scriban-txt` — NEW prompt
- `ClassifyImportContent.scriban-txt` — Four-class output
- `Vocabulary.razor` — Type filter dropdown added

# Filter Pattern Decision: Type Filter Uses Dropdown

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Author:** Kaylee (Full-stack Dev)  
**Scope:** Vocabulary list page type filter

## Decision

The LexicalUnitType filter on the Vocabulary list uses the same `<select>` dropdown pattern as all other filters (Association, Status, Encoding, etc.) rather than a segmented control or pill toggle group.

## Rationale

- Consistency with 6 existing filter dropdowns on the page
- Scales if more types are added later
- Works identically in desktop filter row and mobile offcanvas panel
- Integrates with search-query-driven filter system (`type:word` in search bar)
- Unknown type excluded from options (fallback classification, not user intent)

## Impact

If the team later decides segmented controls or pill toggles are better for enum-style filters across the app, this would be a good candidate to convert — but for now, uniformity wins.

# Decision: Per-item result detail on ContentImportResult

**Date:** 2025-07-25
**Author:** Wash (Backend Dev)
**Branch:** feature/import-content

## Summary

Added per-row detail to `ContentImportResult` so the Import Complete screen can show exactly what happened to each row (created/updated/skipped/failed) with linkable vocabulary IDs and curated reasons.

## New Types

### `ImportItemStatus` enum
- `Created` — new VocabularyWord inserted
- `Updated` — existing VocabularyWord modified (DedupMode.Update)
- `Skipped` — duplicate found (DB or intra-batch)
- `Failed` — row could not be imported (empty term, etc.)

### `ContentImportItemResult` class
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VocabularyWordId` | `string?` | Null only when Status=Failed and no DB row created |
| `Lemma` | `string` | The target-language term |
| `NativeLanguageTerm` | `string` | Translation (empty string if unavailable) |
| `Type` | `LexicalUnitType` | Word / Phrase / Sentence |
| `Status` | `ImportItemStatus` | Created / Updated / Skipped / Failed |
| `Reason` | `string?` | Null for Created/Updated; curated user-facing message for Skipped/Failed |

### `ContentImportResult.Items`
- Type: `IReadOnlyList<ContentImportItemResult>`
- Default: `Array.Empty<ContentImportItemResult>()`
- Aggregate counts (`CreatedCount`, `SkippedCount`, `UpdatedCount`, `FailedCount`) remain for summary cards.
- Invariant: `Items.Count == CreatedCount + SkippedCount + UpdatedCount + FailedCount`

## Curated Reason Strings (stable for Kaylee's UI)
- **Skipped (DB duplicate):** `"Already exists in resource"`
- **Skipped (intra-batch):** `"Duplicate within batch"`
- **Failed (empty target):** `"Target language term is empty"`
- **Failed (empty native):** `"Native language term is empty (AI translation not yet implemented)"`

## Logging Contract
Every Failed branch calls:
```csharp
_logger.LogError("Import row failed for lemma {Lemma} (type {Type}): {Reason}", lemma, type, curatedReason);
```
Raw exceptions (when present) are passed as the first arg to `LogError(ex, ...)` so they appear in Aspire structured logs. The curated `Reason` on the DTO stays user-friendly.

## Kaylee Integration Notes
- `Items` is populated in the same order as `selectedRows` iteration
- `VocabularyWordId` on Created/Updated/Skipped rows is always non-null and can be used for navigation to `/vocabulary/{id}`
- Failed rows with `VocabularyWordId == null` should not render a link
- `Reason` can be displayed inline in the table row for Skipped/Failed statuses

## Tests
8 new tests added covering all statuses, sentence type, intra-batch dedup, mixed-batch aggregate invariant, and logger verification. Total: 32 ContentImportService tests passing.

# Decision: ImportResultStore Lifetime & URL-Param Strategy

**Author:** Kaylee (Full-stack Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Status:** Shipped

## Context

The Import Complete view needs to survive browser back-navigation (user clicks a vocab detail link, then hits Back). Blazor Server/Hybrid re-initializes the page component on each navigation, so in-memory state is lost.

## Decision

### Singleton lifetime for `IImportResultStore`

**Choice: Singleton** (not Scoped).

**Rationale:**
- SentenceStudio is a single-user app. There is exactly one Blazor circuit active at a time (MAUI Hybrid) or one authenticated session (webapp). No risk of cross-user data leakage.
- Scoped in Blazor Server means per-circuit, which is functionally identical to Singleton for this single-user scenario but adds DI complexity if we ever need to access the store from non-circuit code (e.g., background jobs).
- A 30-minute TTL with lazy eviction prevents unbounded memory growth.
- If the app ever becomes multi-user, upgrade to Scoped + per-user keying.

### URL parameter strategy

After `CommitImportAsync`, we:
1. `var key = ImportResultStore.Save(importResult);`
2. `NavManager.NavigateTo($"/import-content?completed={key}", forceLoad: false);`

On `OnInitializedAsync`, if `?completed={guid}` is present, hydrate from store.

**Why URL param instead of NavigationState or SessionStorage:**
- URL param is the simplest approach that works identically in MAUI Hybrid and Blazor Server.
- Browser Back button preserves the URL including the query string, so re-navigation re-hydrates automatically.
- No JS interop required (unlike SessionStorage).
- The GUID key is opaque and meaningless to the user — no data leakage in the URL.

## Risks

- If the server restarts within 30 minutes, the store is lost and the user sees a blank import page. Acceptable for this use case (they can re-import).
- If multiple imports are done in rapid succession, old keys remain in memory until TTL expires. ConcurrentDictionary + lazy eviction handles this cleanly.

# Decision: v1.3 Import Detail — E2E Verdict

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Agent:** Jayne (Tester)
**Feature:** v1.3 Import Complete view with per-row detail table
**Branch:** `feature/import-content`
**Commits:** `35e0ba1` (Wash), `111418f` (Kaylee)

## Verdict: SHIP

**7/7 tests PASS.** No regressions, no blockers.

### Key findings:
1. Summary cards (Created/Skipped/Updated/Failed) render correctly with accurate counts
2. Per-row detail table shows Lemma, Translation, Type badge, Status badge, and Reason
3. Filter pills work correctly — show/hide by status, conditional visibility when count=0
4. Row clicks navigate to vocab detail for both Skipped (existing) and Created (new) items
5. Back-navigation preserves full Import Complete state via IImportResultStore
6. Failed rows are not reproducible through malformed user input (AI extraction is resilient)
7. Zero errors in Aspire structured logs and distributed traces

# Decision: Preview Duplicate Detection — DTO Contract for Kaylee

**Date:** 2026-07-25
**Author:** Wash (Backend Dev)
**Branch:** `feature/import-content`

## Summary

Added duplicate-detection enrichment to the import preview so users see which rows already exist in the database BEFORE committing. The same matching predicate used by `CommitImportAsync` is now extracted into a shared helper (`NormalizeTargetTerm`) and reused by `EnrichPreviewWithDuplicateInfoAsync`.

## New DTO Properties on `ImportRow`

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IsDuplicate` | `bool` | `true` if this row matches an existing vocabulary word in the DB (commit with `DedupMode.Skip` will skip it). Default: `false`. |
| `DuplicateReason` | `string?` | Stable enum-style key. `null` when `IsDuplicate` is `false`. |

### DuplicateReason Values

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"AlreadyInVocabulary"` | Term already exists in the `VocabularyWord` table (exact match on trimmed `TargetLanguageTerm`, case-sensitive). |
| `"DuplicateWithinBatch"` | Same term appears earlier in this preview batch (second+ occurrence). |

## New Interface Method

```csharp
Task EnrichPreviewWithDuplicateInfoAsync(ContentImportPreview preview, CancellationToken ct = default);
```

**Call this after `ParseContentAsync` returns and before rendering the preview table.** It mutates the `ImportRow` objects in place (sets `IsDuplicate` and `DuplicateReason`).

## UI Integration (Kaylee)

1. After `ParseContentAsync` returns, call `await ImportService.EnrichPreviewWithDuplicateInfoAsync(previewResult);`
2. In the preview table, check `row.IsDuplicate`:
   - If `true` with reason `"AlreadyInVocabulary"`: show a badge like "Already in vocabulary"
   - If `true` with reason `"DuplicateWithinBatch"`: show "Duplicate in batch"
3. Localized display strings are your domain — the reason keys are stable and won't change.
4. Duplicate rows remain `IsSelected = true` by default — users can still include them if they switch to `DedupMode.Update` or `ImportAll`.

## Performance

Single batched DB query per `EnrichPreviewWithDuplicateInfoAsync` call (uses `WHERE IN` with a `HashSet` of normalized terms). No N+1.

## Tests Added

4 new tests (36 total):
- `EnrichPreview_FlagsExactDuplicate_WhenTermExistsInDb`
- `EnrichPreview_DoesNotFlag_NearMiss_DifferentLemma`
- `EnrichPreview_UsesBatchQuery_NotNPlusOne`
- `EnrichPreview_MatchesCommitBehavior_RoundTrip` (invariant: Preview's IsDuplicate matches Commit's Skip/Create)

# Decision: Import Content page style normalization

**Date:** 2026-07-27
**Author:** Kaylee (Full-stack Dev)
**Branch:** `feature/import-content`

## Problem

ImportContent.razor accumulated bespoke inline styles that didn't match the rest of the webapp: a custom purple hex color (`#6f42c1`) with inline `background-color`/`color` CSS vars on the Phrase type badge, inline `cursor:pointer` on clickable table rows (rest of app uses `role="button"`), and inline `font-size:0.75rem` on a link icon.

## What Changed

### Style cleanup (merged in commit 3130810)

| Before | After | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `bg-purple` + inline `style="--bs-purple:#6f42c1;color:var(--bs-purple);background-color:rgba(111,66,193,0.1);"` | `bg-secondary bg-opacity-10 text-secondary` | Standard Bootstrap 5 color; no custom CSS vars needed |
| `class="cursor-pointer"` + `style="cursor:pointer;"` on `<tr>` | `role="button"` | Matches app-wide pattern; CSS rule at app.css:1360 handles cursor |
| `style="cursor:pointer;"` on mobile card `<div>` | `role="button"` | Same pattern |
| `style="font-size:0.75rem;"` on link icon | Bootstrap `small` class | Utility class, no inline style |
| Empty `@(isClickable ? "" : "")` class expression on mobile card | Removed | Dead code |

### Kept (justified) inline styles

- Table `<th>` `width` values (40px–110px) — functional column sizing; no Bootstrap class equivalent
- `max-width:220px` on truncated reason text — functional, documented with comment

### Duplicate badge column (merged in commit 3130810)

Wash landed `IsDuplicate` and `DuplicateReason` on `ImportRow`; the preview table now includes a "Duplicate" column using `badge bg-warning bg-opacity-10 text-warning` with `bi-files` icon. Rows are still committable (heads-up only). 5 new resx keys (EN + KO).

## Pattern for Future Agents

- **Clickable non-button elements**: Use `role="button"` — never inline `cursor:pointer`
- **Type badges**: Use standard Bootstrap opacity badge pattern: `badge bg-{color} bg-opacity-10 text-{color}` where `{color}` is primary/secondary/info/success/warning/danger
- **Status badges**: `badge bg-{semantic-color}` (solid, not opacity-tinted)
- **No custom hex colors in Razor markup** — use CSS vars or Bootstrap named colors only
