### 2026-02-18: User directive — Page-by-page audit
**By:** David Ortinau (Captain) (via Copilot)
**What:** Go back page by page, compare Blazor Hybrid to native MauiReactor, find the gaps, fix them, and have the team review. Pay attention to: loading UI when data loads, wrong overlays that aren't used, missing features entirely, and different experiences between the two versions.
**Why:** User request — the native port has gaps vs the Blazor source of truth. Need systematic audit and fixes.
